    "description" : "Villa Tortuga pairs a low, modern profile with warm wood accents and soft lighting, set among palms for a relaxed streetscape. Inside, airy rooms and a lofty kitchen–dining space use pale oak, stone, and matte black details for quiet sophistication, while calm bedrooms and a spa-like bath open to a pool terrace made for easy coastal living."
