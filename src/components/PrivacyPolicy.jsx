        <h2 id="info-do-not-track">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard or
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
          Notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
          browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or
          legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
          respond to them at this time.

        <h2>How to Exercise Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          To exercise these rights, you can contact us by submitting a data
          subject access request, by emailing us at info@dcddevelopments.com, or
          by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
          authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a
          request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they
          have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with
          applicable laws.
        </p>
        <h2>Request Verification</h2>
        <p>
          Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
          determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
          in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
          request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
          However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information
          already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional
          information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
          security or fraud-prevention purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
          collect additional information to verify your identity before
          processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written
          and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
        </p>
        <h2>Appeals</h2>
        <p>
          Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take
          action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing
          us at info@dcddevelopments.com. We will inform you in writing of any
          action taken in response to the appeal, including a written
          explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If your appeal is
          denied, you may submit a complaint to your state authority.
